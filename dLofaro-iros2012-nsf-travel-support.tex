\section*{Paper Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item Number: 1255
\item Title: \textit{Humanoid Throwing: Design of Collision-Free Trajectories with Sparse Reachable Maps}
\item Description: Design, simulation and hardware testing of a method to create collision-free throwing trajectories for high degree of freedom manipulators. 
\end{itemize}


\section*{Expected Impact on Professional Development}
Daniel M. Lofaro's overarching goal is to become a teaching/research faculty at a university in the United States of America.  
Daniel believes that the key for his and America's continuing success in science and engineering stems from successes with international research collaboration.
Since 2008 Daniel has been focusing on improving his international collaboration, a desired trait in the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields.
The next critical step needed for Daniel to achieve his overarching goal is to become a Fulbright fellow giving him key international collaboration experience.  
Becoming a Fulbright fellow will set Daniel apart from his peers of similar education and background.
The expected impact of participating in IROS 2012 is allowing Daniel to find a foreign advisor willing to have him as a Fulbright fellow.
IROS 2012 is an international event with numerous of Daniel's foreign colleagues in his field of study, thus it is the ideal setting for him to find an advisor for Fulbright.
The new and strengthened relationships morphed from ICRA 2012 will play a key roll in Daniel's acceptance to the highly respected and competitive Fulbright fellowship program.
The latter gives Daniel key experience needed for his professional development and achieving his overarching goal of becoming a teaching/research faculty at a university in the United States of America.
