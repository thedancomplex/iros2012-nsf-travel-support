\section*{Expected Impact on Professional Development}
Daniel M. Lofaro ultimate goal is to become a teaching/research faculty at a university in the United States of America.  
Daniel believes that the key for America's continuing success in science and engineering stems from the successes with international research collaboration.
Since 2008 Daniel has been focusing on improving his international collaboration which is a desired trait in a Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) field.
The next critical step needed for Daniel to improve his international collaboration skills is to become a Fulbright fellowship.


The expected impact of participation in IROS 2012 on the Daniel's professional development includes. Strengthening Daniel's collaboration in Europe 


 is how Daniel is setting himself apart from other similar applicants.  plans on developing his professional career by applying for a Fulbright fellowship to gain international collaboration experience.
An overseas collaborator is needed to fulfill Daniel's ultimate goal.
